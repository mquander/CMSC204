Leadership does not mean domination.
The world is always well supplied,
with people who wish to rule and dominate
others. The true leader is a
different sort; he seeks effective
activity which has a truly beneficient
purpose. He inspires others to
follow in his wake, and holding aloft
the torch of wisdom, leads the way for
society to realize its genuinely
great aspirations.
